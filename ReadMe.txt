##Project Overview and Notes

Eswatini is a small country in Southern AFrica with one of the highest rates of 
unemployment on the continent. This webapp will allow users to share various 
resources for the youth in Eswatini such as suchalrships, grants, internships, and 
jobs. 

User logs in and can contribute to the list of resources which have been shared. 
I will have to find a way to ensure that users are sharing useful resources.
